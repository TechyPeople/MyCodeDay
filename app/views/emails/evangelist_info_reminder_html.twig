    <p>Hi {{ user.first_name }},</p>

   <p>CodeDay is fast-approaching, and in order to successfully host the event, we need your contact phone number. On
       the day of the event, if any parents need to reach event staff, it will be routed to you. (We will not give out
       this number directly; it goes through our phone system.)</p>

    <p>You can enter your contact number <a href="https://s5.studentrnd.org/me/edit">on s5</a>.</p>

    {% if loaded_batch.starts_at.addDays(-8).isPast() %}
        <p>This information is <strong>OVERDUE!</strong> Please enter it as soon as possible!</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Please enter it by <strong>{{ loaded_batch.starts_at.addDays(-8).timestamp|date('l, F j') }}</strong>.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>Cheers!<br />
    The StudentRND Team</p>
