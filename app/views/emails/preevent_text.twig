Is it really that time?

Yes, yes it is. Dearest attendees, it is almost time for CodeDay. Grab your friends, grab your laptops, and grab a ride, because it all starts this Saturday at noon.

This email will tell you everything you need to know about CodeDay. If you have any other questions, you can reply to this email.


**What to Bring**

You don't need much, but you do need these things:

{% if registration.event.waiver_link %}
- The completed waiver: {{ registration.event.waiver_link }}
{% endif %}
- Laptop (or desktop with wifi card)
- Any software you need. If you're a beginner using Windows, we recommend you download the free edition of Construct 2.

**Waiver**

This was in the last section, but it's worth mentioning again. You must bring a copy of the completed waiver. Please
print this out now: {{ registration.event.waiver_link }}
{% endif %}


**What to Use**

- Beginner teams: We strongly recommend making a game in Construct 2. There are lots of beginner-friendly tutorials online. Plus, we'll be hosting workshops to help you get started.
- Advanced teams: Use whatever you want. There aren't any limits on the technology or what you can build. Just remember, if you use something really odd, there's very little chance anyone on-hand will be able to help you.
