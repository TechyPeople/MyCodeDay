    <p>Is it really that time?</p>
    <p>Yes, yes it is. Dearest attendees, it is almost time for CodeDay. Grab your friends, grab your laptops, and grab
        a ride, because it all starts this Saturday at noon.</p>
    <p>This email will tell you everything you need to know about CodeDay. If you have any other questions, you can
        reply to this email.</p>

    <h2>What to Bring</h2>
    <p>You don't need much, but you do need these things:</p>
    <ul>
        {% if registration.event.waiver_link %}
            <li>The <a href="{{ registration.event.waiver_link }}">completed waiver</a></li>
        {% endif %}
        <li>Laptop (or desktop with wifi card)</li>
        <li>Any software you need. If you're a beginner using Windows, we recommend you download the free edition of
            <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2">Construct 2</a>.</li>
        <li>Sleeping bag if you plan on sleeping</li>
        <li>Ideas (optional, but strongly recommended)</li>
    </ul>

    {% if registration.event.waiver_link %}
        <h2>Waiver</h2>

        <p>This was in the last section, but it's worth mentioning again. You must bring
           <a href="{{ registration.event.waiver_link }}">a copy of the completed waiver.</a> Please print it out now.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <h2>What to Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beginner teams: We strongly recommend making a game in Construct 2. There are lots of beginner-friendly
            tutorials online. Plus, we'll be hosting workshops to help you get started.</li>
        <li>Advanced teams: Use whatever you want. There aren't any limits on the technology or what you can build.
            Just remember, if you use something really odd, there's very little chance anyone on-hand will be able to
            help you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to Go</h2>
    <table width="100%">
