Hey {{ registration.first_name }},

I wanted to quickly reach out and thank you for registering for CodeDay. I'm Tyler, and I'm in charge of StudentRND, the non-profit that runs CodeDay.

I was wondering if you could help me out quickly: before the event starts, I like to get some information on who's coming. I pass this on to our local CodeDay teams so they can better prepare to help everyone out.

Can you quickly fill out this form? It only takes a minute and will really help us make the event better.

Cheers,

(PS: If you have any questions about the event, feel free to reply and I'll try to help you out!)
