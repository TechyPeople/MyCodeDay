    <p>Hi {{ event.venue_contact_first_name }},</p>

    <p>We just wanted to take a quick moment to remind you that we'll be hosting CodeDay {{ managed_batch.name }} at
       {{ event.venue_name }} on {{ event.starts_at|date('F j, Y') }}. This email will give you a bit of information
       about what's happening.</p>

        contradicts anything in this email, your agreement supersedes. If you have any questions, please reply to this

    <h2>Contacts</h2>
    <p>Shortly before the event, we will send you a final list of contacts &mdash; including names, emails, and phone
       numbers &mdash; of all day-of staff. For now, if you have any questions, you should contact
       {{ event.manager.name }}{% if event.manager.phone %} at {{ event.manager.phone }}{% endif %}.</p>

    <h2>Cleaning</h2>
    <p>We will do everything in our power to leave the venue as clean as it was when we arrived. To help us out, we will
        need access to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A broom and dustpan</li>
        <li>Garbage bags</li>
        <li>Dumpsters</li>
        <li>Supplies for washing tables</li>
        <li>If you have a carpeted floor, a vacuum</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of these items will be hard to find, or you have any special requirements, please let us know.</p>

    <h2>Attendees</h2>
    <p>If you need a list of event attendees, you can download one
        <a href="https://clear.codeday.org/event/{{ event.id }}/registrations/csv?signature={{ event.signature }}">here</a>.
        This link will automatically update as participants register, so it's best to download it as close to the
        start of the event as possible.</p>
    <p>(We will be running our own check-in on the day of, so unless you have your own requirements, there's no need to
        worry about this.)</p>

    <p>Cheers,<br />
        The CodeDay Team</p>
