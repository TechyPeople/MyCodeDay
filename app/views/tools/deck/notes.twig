        <h1>CodeDay {{ event.name }} Kickoff Notes</h1>

        <p>Welcome to CodeDay! I'm {{ me.first_name }}, and I'm here to help run the event today.</p>

        <p>I'm really excited to have you all here today. If you need any help or have any questions during the event,
            come find me, it's my job to help out throughout the event.</p>

        <p>We've got a really exciting event today, and remember, you're coding along with students in
            {{ event.batch.events|length }} cities nationwide!</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>At StudentRND, we believe that coding is one of the most fun things in the world, but that most students
            don't see that because they don't have the chance to work on something they care about.</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>The thing is, as a student, there's often not enough time to work on something you care about.</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>You always have a homework assignment due tomorrow. Or a test next week. And you never get the time to do the
            things that you want to do.</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>Well not today, because today is CodeDay.</p>

        <p>CodeDay is a 24-hour programming marathon where you get to build cool apps, games, or just something that
           you've always wanted to build. Something that you think is awesome.</p>
           
       <p>Some of you may have heard the term "hackathon" before. Hackathons are great, but CodeDay isn't one of them.
           CodeDay isn't about showing off for recruiters, being the best of the best, or winning thousands of dollars in prizes.
       </p>
       
       <p>At CodeDay, we just want you to build something you love, learn something new, and meet cool people.</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>While you're sitting here right now, we want everyone to start coming up with cool ideas they might want
            to build.</p>

        <p>For example, I might have an idea for a spaceship game where I have to land a manned probe on the surface
            of the sun.</p>

        <p>Or I might want to build an app where you press a button, and it reverses entropy.</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>We'll start out the event in a few minutes by having everyone come up and pitch these ideas.</p>

        <p>You can pitch as many ideas as you want, and just because you're pitching an idea doesn't mean you have
        to work on it.</p>

        <p>Just list any cool ideas that come to mind.</p>
        
        <p>(If you already came in with a group of people, you still have to pitch your idea!)</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>After pitches, people will form teams around the ideas they think are coolest.</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>Then, you'll get to spend the rest of the 24 hours building that idea!</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>During the event, you should have a lot of fun. We'll get into evening, it'll be midnight, we'll have
           loud music blaring, people will be dancing and drinking lots and lots and lots of soda.
            (Just don't go overboard.)</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>In the morning, you'll present what you built.</p>

        <p>At 9am, judges are going to go around, and then at 10am, you're going to give your presentation and
           say:</p>

        <p>"Hey, remember that idea I had at the start? To make that spaceship game that lands on the sun? Well
            here it is, and look how fun it is to play."</p>

        <p>Or:</p>

        <p>"Hey, I was trying to build that app to reverse entropy, but then I found out that there's this law of
           thermodynamics that prevents anyone from actually reversing entropy."</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>If you get stuck or even if you're totally new, that's okay! Most professional programmers get stuck
           every day!</p>

        <p>I'll be walking around helping teams throughout the event, and you can walk around and talk with other
            students!</p>

        <p>Plus, technology is constantly changing, and the most up-to-date information is available online.</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>We even have some workshops to help you out at the beginning!</p>

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>At the end of the event, we'll be giving out awards to the best app, best game, and the top overall thing
           made at CodeDay.</p>

        <p>Now, before we get to pitches, we have a few sponsors we wanted to thank:</p>


        {% if event.sponsors|length > 0 %}
            <hr class="click"/>

            {% for sponsor in event.sponsors %}
                <p>{{ sponsor.name }}: {{ sponsor.description }}</p>

                <hr class="sponsor"/>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>Splunk: Splunk lets you make your apps and games more fun and addicting. We'll have a workshop
           later today for people working on games at CodeDay to help make them the right amount of
            challenging.</p>

        <hr class="sponsor"/>

        <p>Intellectual Ventures: IV believes in the value of students' ideas. Not only as economic opportunity,
           but as a powerful tool for improving our world. They're here to help fuel the spirit of invention by
           supporting StudentRND and other idea-generating organizations. And by mentoring the next generation
           of Edisons and Teslas.

        <hr class="click"/>

        <p>Okay, now let's go on to pitches.</p>

        <p>Everyone who has an idea for something cool they could make, come up to the front, and describe it
           really briefly.</p>

        <p>This should just be 30 seconds to a minute. Remember, you don't have to build what you pitch, you can
           just pitch any cool ideas you have.</p>

        <p>I'll get us started by pitching one of my ideas...</p>
